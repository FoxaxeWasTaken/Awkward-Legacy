# Pull Request Description

## Description

This PR **improves** the user interface by cleaning up the home page and fixing button alignment issues. The main changes include:

- **Removed redundant CTAs**: Eliminated the separate "Search Families" card since it duplicated the "Manage Families" functionality
- **Unified interface**: Now shows a cleaner 2-card layout with "Upload Family File" and "Search & Manage Families"
- **Fixed button alignment**: Moved the "Choose File" button to the bottom of the upload zone for better visual hierarchy
- **Improved layout**: Optimized grid layout for the new 2-card design
- **Enhanced UX**: Better visual flow and reduced user confusion

The key functionalities (file upload, family browsing, family tree viewing) are all working correctly. However, I'll be opening a new issue to address the parsing and serializer improvements needed for better data handling.
